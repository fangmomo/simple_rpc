# simple_rpc
a simple rpc when i learn it

## remarks
 as for 3-28 ,i hava finished a new rpc service,which uses netty for connecting and transport and uses redis as its sercice center.But this version is a simple version,it can only insert and query a user info by browser,and it provides only no-webpage accessed.and i will make it better.
 ## next step 
 i have a plan to implement a function that we can view and transfer a remote host file by browser .I donot kwon whether i can finish it well,i will try my best.

## As for 4-4
i had finished the function that we can ask a file from server and get the file from server. but donot implement select the directory story file and upload file.

## As for 4-10
- update the fileserver,use a Executor to handle the file request ,so you can open more than two pages to download different files
- update the  send_end and receive_end code, more clear.
- next step ,upload file
